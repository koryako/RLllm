#### Introduction
Utilizing large language models to execute web automation tasks through AI agents, such as automated testing of test cases to alleviate the workload of testers. Often, due to a lack of prior knowledge, the task trajectories generated by language models are unstable and it is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the generated trajectories. We have introduced a trajectory knowledge base to stabilize the model's output. Additionally, through an RL model, we learn the state changes that occur in expert models after executing different tasks, continuously optimizing the policy trajectories, and training our own domain-specific sub-models.

#### Features
- Utilizes knowledge bases such as Flowise and dify, and AI agent workflow frameworks

- Encapsulates a web automation SDK package

- Defines actions according to the characteristics of web HTML and designs an action protocol

- Encodes the current semantic state into a vector
